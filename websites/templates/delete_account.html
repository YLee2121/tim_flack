        <p class="card-text">Deletion is a scary concept.  If you own a blog, you've probably spent months or even years crafting content, gaining followers, and building up your online reputation. You've made a digital footprint in the form of created assets and conversations, all of which took time and care to make.

        Deleting a blog account is serious business. You're not just deleting a username and password combinationâ€”you're deleting your creative content, your unique voice, your history in the community, and the digital space that you occupied.</p>
